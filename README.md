## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_project.git
   cd my_project

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create the .env file using the .env.example as a template:
   cp .env.example .env

5. Ensure your environment variables are correctly set in the .env file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- app/: Contains the main application logic, including:
  - api/: Defines the API endpoints.
  - bot/: Contains the Telegram bot logic, handlers, and middlewares.
  - core/: Core configurations, database models, and security logic.
  - crud/: CRUD operations for interacting with the database.
  - db/: Database models and migrations.
  - schemas/: Pydantic schemas for data validation.
  - services/: Business logic and services like user service, bot service, etc.
  - admin_panel/: Templates, static files, and routes for the admin panel.
  
- tests/: Contains unit and integration tests for various parts of the application (API, bot, database).
- scripts/: Helper scripts for running the bot, initializing the database, and managing deployments.
- infra/: Docker-related configurations and CI/CD files.
- .env: Environment variables.
- .env.example: Template for environment variables.
- requirements.txt: Python package dependencies.
- pyproject.toml: Poetry configuration for managing project dependencies.

## Configuration

Set the necessary environment variables in the .env file:

- DB_URL: URL for the database connection.
- BOT_API_KEY: Telegram bot API key.
- SECRET_KEY: Secret key for app security.
- Other project-specific configuration variables.
